# Accessibility-Refactoring-Horiseon

## Description 

This repository was created to refactor Horiseon Services' website to be more accessible to everyone.  The website should now have working links, alt attributes, and a style sheet that is more easily manageable.  Another goal of this was to clean up the index.html and style.css sheets.  Starting with the implementation of more html elements that lead to easier styling in turn.  Through this project I was able to identify elements easier and get more hands on experience with troubleshooting issues.  I was also introduced to more elements such as "aside" and "section".  These elements alone introduced me to so much more information and valuable knowledge.

This website is very simple to use.  You have three href links on the top of the webpage that will take you to the three main secitons.  From there you can read all the info that the webpage has to offer!
